# Coordinator Management Feature - Deployment Status

## Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS

The coordinator management feature has been successfully built and is ready for production deployment.

### Completed Steps

1. ✅ **Database Migration**: No migration required - StudyCoordinator model already exists
2. ✅ **Production Build**: Successfully built with Next.js (commit: e1b9b40)
3. ✅ **Code Fixes**: All import path errors and ESLint issues resolved
4. ✅ **Git Commit**: All changes committed and pushed to origin/main
5. ✅ **Code Review**: Feature implementation complete per GitHub issue #8

### Build Details

**Commit**: `e1b9b40` - "fix: Correct import paths and escape quotes for production build"
**Branch**: main
**Build Time**: 2025-10-20
**Build Output**:
- Route: `/studies/[id]/coordinators` - 2.8 kB (99.4 kB total)
- All API routes compiled successfully
- No TypeScript or ESLint blocking errors

### Deployment Options

The project supports three deployment methods (defined in `package.json`):

1. **Google Cloud Run** (Recommended for production)
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:cloudrun
   ```
   - Requires: GCP_PROJECT_ID, GCP credentials
   - Configuration: `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`
   - Note: GitHub Actions workflows exist locally but not pushed to remote yet

2. **Vercel**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:vercel
   ```
   - Simple deployment via Vercel CLI
   - Automatic builds on push

3. **Firebase**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:firebase
   ```
   - Requires Firebase project setup

### Manual Deployment Steps

Since GitHub Actions workflows are not yet active on the remote repository, deployment should be done manually:

#### Option 1: Vercel (Quickest)
```bash
cd "C:\Users\jeffr\IRB try 2"
npm run deploy:vercel
```

#### Option 2: Cloud Run (Production-grade)
```bash
# Requires GCP CLI and credentials
cd "C:\Users\jeffr\IRB try 2"
npm run deploy:cloudrun
```

#### Option 3: Push Workflows and Use GitHub Actions
```bash
# Workflows exist locally at .github/workflows/
# They need to be committed from the repository root
# Then trigger via: gh workflow run deploy-production.yml -f confirm_deployment=deploy-to-production
```

### Environment Variables Required

For production deployment, ensure these environment variables are configured:

- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret for JWT token generation
- `AIGENTS_API_URL` - Aigents integration URL
- `AIGENTS_EMAIL` - Aigents service account email
- `AIGENTS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Webhook authentication secret
- `AIGENTS_FOLDER_ID` - Aigents folder identifier
- `NODE_ENV=production`

### Feature Summary

**What's Deployed**:
- Study coordinator assignment management UI (`/studies/[id]/coordinators`)
- Coordinator-specific dashboard (`/dashboard/coordinator`)
- API endpoints for coordinator CRUD operations
- Permission-based access control
- Audit logging for all coordinator actions
- E2E test coverage

**Database Changes**: None required (existing schema already supports the feature)

### Next Steps

1. Choose deployment method (Vercel recommended for quick deployment)
2. Configure production environment variables
3. Run deployment command
4. Verify deployment at production URL
5. Run E2E tests against production
6. Update GitHub issue #8 with deployment URL
7. (Optional) Set up GitHub Actions by ensuring .github directory is tracked

### Testing the Deployment

After deployment, verify:
1. `/api/health` - Health check endpoint
2. `/dashboard/coordinator` - Coordinator dashboard (as coordinator user)
3. `/studies/[id]/coordinators` - Coordinator management (as PI/admin)
4. `/api/studies/[id]/coordinators` - API endpoints

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
- Previous commit: `a7c911b` - "fix: Allow multiple hyphens in protocol number validation"
- Rollback command: `git revert e1b9b40 742ba88`
- Or use Cloud Run revision rollback (if using GCP)
