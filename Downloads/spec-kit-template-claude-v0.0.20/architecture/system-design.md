# Research Study Management System - Architecture Design

## System Overview

The Research Study Management System follows a microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns, enabling scalability, maintainability, and compliance with healthcare regulations.

## Core Architecture Principles

1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Each bounded context (Study Management, Participant Management, Data Collection, etc.) is a separate service
2. **Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate via event bus for loose coupling
3. **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read and write models for complex domains
4. **API Gateway**: Single entry point for all client requests
5. **Service Mesh**: For service discovery, load balancing, and observability

## System Components

### 1. Frontend Layer
- **Researcher Portal**: Web application for study management
- **Participant Portal**: Mobile-responsive interface for participants
- **Admin Dashboard**: System administration and monitoring
- **Mobile Apps**: Native iOS/Android apps for field data collection

### 2. API Gateway Layer

- Request routing
- Rate limiting
- API versioning
- Request/Response transformation

### 3. Core Services

### 4. Data Layer

#### Primary Databases
- **PostgreSQL**: Transactional data for each service
- **MongoDB**: Document store for forms and unstructured data
- **TimescaleDB**: Time-series data for audit logs

#### Caching Layer
- **Redis**: Session management and caching
- **CDN**: Static asset delivery

#### Data Warehouse

- **Elasticsearch**: Full-text search across studies and participants

#### File Storage
- **S3/Azure Blob**: Document storage (consent forms, protocols)

#### Security
- **Vault**: Secrets management
- **Key Management Service**: Encryption key rotation

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Field-level encryption for PHI
- Data masking and de-identification

### Compliance

- 21 CFR Part 11 electronic signatures
- GDPR data privacy
- GCP compliance

## Deployment Architecture

### Container Orchestration
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Helm**: Package management

### CI/CD Pipeline
