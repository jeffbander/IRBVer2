# Research Study Management System Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Study-First Architecture
Every feature starts with study requirements; Components must support multi-study workflows; Clear separation between study protocols and participant data

### II. Data Integrity & Compliance
HIPAA-compliant data handling mandatory; All PHI must be encrypted at rest and in transit; Comprehensive audit logging for all data operations

### III. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced; Minimum 80% code coverage required

### IV. Modular Component Design
Each study component independently deployable; Clear interfaces between study management, data collection, and analysis modules; Shared services for authentication, authorization, and audit

### V. User-Centric Interface
Researcher workflows prioritized; Mobile-responsive for participant interfaces; Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) required

### VI. Observability & Monitoring
Structured logging for all operations; Real-time dashboard for study progress; Alert system for protocol deviations and system issues

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint + Prettier for consistent formatting
- Conventional commits for version history
- Feature branch workflow with PR reviews

### Security Requirements
- Zero-trust security model
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication for researchers
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Performance Standards
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- API response time < 200ms for 95th percentile
- Support for 10,000+ concurrent participants
- 99.9% uptime SLA

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development
1. Specification review and approval
2. Test plan creation
3. Implementation with TDD
4. Code review (minimum 2 approvers)
5. Integration testing
6. Security review for data-touching features
7. Deployment to staging
8. User acceptance testing
9. Production deployment

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Code coverage maintained above 80%
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation updated

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require:
- Documentation of proposed change
- Impact analysis
- Team consensus
- Migration plan for existing code

All PRs must verify compliance with constitution principles; Complexity must be justified with clear documentation
