# Feature Specification: Research Study Management System

**Feature Branch**: `001-research-study-management`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a comprehensive research study management platform for clinical trials and academic research"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user requirements for study management
   → Core: Study creation, participant enrollment, data collection
2. Identify key stakeholders
   → Researchers, Study Coordinators, Participants, Data Analysts, IRB
3. Define compliance requirements
   → HIPAA, GCP, 21 CFR Part 11, IRB protocols
4. Map participant journey
   → Screening → Enrollment → Consent → Data Collection → Follow-up
5. Establish data workflows
   → Protocol definition → Data capture → Validation → Export
6. Security and access control design
   → Role-based permissions, audit trails, data encryption
7. Integration requirements
   → EDC systems, EHR, laboratory systems, statistical packages
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a clinical researcher, I need to create and manage multiple research studies, enroll participants, collect data according to study protocols, and analyze results while maintaining regulatory compliance.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a researcher with proper credentials, **When** they create a new study, **Then** the system generates a complete study framework with protocol templates
2. **Given** an eligible participant, **When** they provide informed consent, **Then** the system enrolls them and tracks their progress through the study
3. **Given** a study coordinator, **When** they enter participant data, **Then** the system validates against the protocol and flags any deviations
4. **Given** a data analyst, **When** they request study data, **Then** the system exports validated, de-identified datasets in required formats
5. **Given** an IRB reviewer, **When** they access the system, **Then** they can review all study protocols and participant safety data

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a participant withdraws consent mid-study?
- How does system handle protocol amendments during active enrollment?
- What occurs when data validation fails during critical safety reporting?
- How are adverse events escalated and reported?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow creation of multi-site, multi-arm study protocols
- **FR-002**: System MUST capture and validate electronic informed consent with timestamp and IP tracking
- **FR-003**: System MUST support configurable data collection forms with branching logic
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain complete audit trail of all data changes with user attribution
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate automatic protocol deviation reports
- **FR-006**: System MUST support participant randomization with stratification
- **FR-007**: System MUST enable secure participant communication and appointment scheduling
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide real-time study metrics and enrollment dashboards
- **FR-009**: System MUST export data in CDISC, REDCap, and custom formats
- **FR-010**: System MUST support adverse event reporting with automatic escalation
- **FR-011**: System MUST enforce data entry windows and visit schedules
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide role-based access control with delegation logs
- **FR-013**: System MUST support electronic signatures per 21 CFR Part 11
- **FR-014**: System MUST enable query management for data clarification
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain participant retention tracking and follow-up reminders

### Key Entities
- **Study**: Research protocol with phases, arms, sites, and enrollment targets
- **Participant**: Enrolled subject with demographics, consent status, and study progress
- **Protocol**: Study design including visits, procedures, and data collection requirements
- **Visit**: Scheduled or unscheduled participant interaction with data collection
- **Form**: Configurable data entry template with validation rules
- **User**: System user with role, permissions, and delegation authority
- **Site**: Physical location conducting the study with staff and resources
- **Consent**: Documented agreement with version control and withdrawal options
- **Query**: Data clarification request with resolution workflow
- **Report**: Configurable output for safety, progress, or regulatory submission
